# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
CoolerDash is a small personal open-source project.  
Only the latest version is actively maintained. Please always update to the newest release before reporting issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.  
Instead, contact the project maintainer directly:

- **Email:** [damachin3@proton.me]  
- or open a **private security advisory** via GitHub (under the "Security" tab of the repository).

Please include as much detail as possible so we can understand and reproduce the issue.  
We aim to respond to security reports within a reasonable timeframe and will keep you updated on the progress.

## Responsible Disclosure
We kindly ask you to give us a chance to fix vulnerabilities before disclosing them publicly.  
This helps keep all users safe and ensures patches are available quickly.
