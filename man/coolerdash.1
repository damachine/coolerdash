.SH LOGGING SYSTEM
CoolerDash uses an intelligent four-level logging system:
.TP
.B STATUS
Important startup and operational messages (always shown, visible in systemd logs)
.TP
.B INFO
Detailed debug information (only shown with \fB\-\-log\fR parameter)
.TP
.B WARNING

.TP
.B Examples
.B coolerdash
.br
Shows STATUS, WARNING, and ERROR messages only for clean production logs.
.br
.B coolerdash --log
.br
Shows all logging levels including detailed INFO messages for debugging.
.br
.B journalctl -u coolerdash.service
.br
View systemd logs (STATUS messages always visible without --log parameter).

.SH SYSTEMD INTEGRATION
The program provides systemd integration with detailed logs:
.TP
.B Service Installation
.B make install
.br
Automatically installs the service and restarts it on updates.
.TP
.B Service Management
.B systemctl enable coolerdash.service
.br
.B systemctl start coolerdash.service
.br
.B systemctl status coolerdash.service
.TP
.B Detailed Logs
.B journalctl -u coolerdash.service --since "10 minutes ago"
.br
Shows module initialization, CoolerControl connection, and operating status.
Important STATUS messages are always visible without requiring \fB\-\-log\fR parameter.
.br
.B journalctl -u coolerdash.service -f
.br
Live log monitoring for real-time troubleshooting.
.TP
.B Makefile Service Shortcuts
.B make start, make stop, make restart, make status, make logs

.SH SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
CoolerDash follows security best practices and does not require root privileges:
.TP
.B Dedicated User Service
Runs as user 'coolerdash' via systemd, not as root.
.TP
.B API Communication Only
Communicates via CoolerControl's HTTP REST API (port 11987) - no direct hardware access.
.TP

.SH CONFIGURATION
All important runtime and build-time settings are managed via configuration files:
.TP
.B /etc/coolerdash/config.ini (RECOMMENDED)
Main runtime configuration file. Edit this file to change display, thresholds, colors, paths, and daemon settings without recompiling.
After editing, restart the service with:
.br
\fBsystemctl restart coolerdash.service\fR
.br

.SH PATH MANAGEMENT
CoolerDash uses intelligent path management for optimal compatibility:
.TP
.B Universal Access
All temporary files are stored in /tmp/ for universal read/write access without permission issues.
.TP
.B Automatic Cleanup
Temporary files are automatically cleaned up on normal shutdown and signal termination:
.br
• Image files: /tmp/coolerdash.png
.br
• PID files: /tmp/coolerdash.pid
.TP
.B File Lifecycle
Normal shutdown: Files cleaned via main cleanup routine
.br
Signal termination (SIGTERM/SIGINT): Files cleaned via signal handler
.br
Force kill (SIGKILL): Files may remain but are cleaned on next start

.SH DEPENDENCIES
.TP
.B CoolerControl (REQUIRED)
Must be installed and running (coolercontrold.service and coolercontrol-liqctld.service)
.br
Installation guide: https://gitlab.com/coolercontrol/coolercontrol/-/blob/main/README.md
.TP
.B Build Dependencies
GCC with C99 support, Make, pkg-config
.TP
.B Runtime Libraries
Cairo (graphics rendering), cURL (HTTP client), jansson (JSON parsing), inih (INI file parsing)

.SH INSTALLATION
Installs the main binary to /usr/bin/coolerdash.
Resources and images are installed to /opt/coolerdash/.
Systemd service file is installed to /etc/systemd/system/coolerdash.service.
Default config file is installed to /etc/coolerdash/config.ini.
Temporary files are managed in /tmp/ for universal access.
.TP
.B Standard Installation
.B make install
.br
Installs all components and enables the systemd service.
.TP
.B PKGBUILD and AUR
Arch Linux users can build and install via PKGBUILD and AUR. See PKGBUILD for details.

.SH UNINSTALL
.TP
.B Standard Uninstall
.B make uninstall
.br
Stops and disables the service, removes all installed files from /usr/bin/, /opt/coolerdash/, and /etc/systemd/system/.
The config file /etc/coolerdash/config.ini is preserved unless unchanged from defaults.
.TP
.B Manual Cleanup
If needed, manually remove remaining files:
.br
.B rm -rf /opt/coolerdash/ /etc/coolerdash/
.TP
.B PKGBUILD
Arch Linux users can uninstall via package manager: \fBpacman -R coolerdash\fR

.SH USAGE
.TP
.B Start program (clean production logging):
.B coolerdash
.TP
.B Start program with detailed debug logging:
.B coolerdash --log
.TP
.B Show help:
.B coolerdash --help
.TP
.B Service management:
.B systemctl start coolerdash
.br
.B systemctl status coolerdash
.br
.B systemctl restart coolerdash
.br
.B journalctl -u coolerdash -f

> **Note:** The systemd service must be stopped before running manually to avoid conflicts:
.B
systemctl stop coolerdash.service

.TP
.B \-\-log
Enable detailed INFO logging for debugging purposes. Without this parameter, only STATUS, WARNING, and ERROR messages are shown for clean production logs.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Display help information and exit.

.SH NOTES

- After editing config.ini, restart the service to apply changes.
- If config.ini is missing, build-time defaults from include/config.h are used.
- Intelligent path management uses /tmp/ for universal access without permission issues.
- Double LCD transmission ensures reliable image upload with enhanced stability.
- Automatic file cleanup removes temporary files on shutdown/termination.
- Optimized refresh cycles provide immediate LCD updates without unnecessary delays.
- All code is documented with Doxygen-style comments and follows strict coding standards.
- See PKGBUILD and Makefile for build and packaging documentation.
